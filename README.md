## Introduction

Zombi is a task runner and scaffolding tool that makes bootstrapping new projects a cinch! It has an easy-to-learn, pipe-style API. It is still a **Work-in-progress**, but will be ready for prime-time soon. In the meanwhile, please refer to the source code as a reference for how the library works. Zombi shares a few concepts with [RxJS](https://rxjs-dev.firebaseapp.com/), so if you're familiar with Observables, this library will feel familiar, too.

## Ecosystem

Zombi is managed as a monorepo so that core functionality and common scaffolds are distributed separately.
